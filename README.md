# Nudeps Demos

A demo repository to showcase how nudeps works.

This is essentially a monorepo, containing multiple demos, each in a separate directory.

## How to try out locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nudeps/nudeps-demo.git
```

Then to e.g. try out the Vue demo run:

`cd vue && npm install`

That's it!

Then, start a local server and open the various `index.html` files in your browser.

You can try installing and uninstalling dependencies as needed, and see how the import map gets updated.
